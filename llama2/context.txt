PyTorch Project to Build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset
Overview
Have you ever wondered how photo editing applications are able to convert night
images to day images? Also, you must have come across some photos of people who
do not exist in the world. One of the powerful tools to achieve this is Generative
Adversarial Networks also known as GAN. The GANs are mainly used in
image-to-image translation and to generate photorealistic images which even a human
fails to identify as fake or true.
In this project, we start by introducing Generative Adversarial Networks. The PyTorch
framework is used to build the GAN model on the MNIST dataset. Finally, we learn how
to use the Generator model for generating new images of digits.
Aim
1. To understand the theory behind Generative Adversarial Network
2. To build Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch
